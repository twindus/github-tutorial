Here is a brand new file called text3.

"I am floating away
Caught in a solid ballet
I'm dreaming you out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view...

Late nights and early parades
Still photos of noisy arcades
I'm dreaming you out in the blue
And I am right beside you
And we can go anywhere...

Are you there?
Are you there?"

-- Owl City (Adam Young), "On the Wing"


(with my slight lyric modification)
