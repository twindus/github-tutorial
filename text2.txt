Quotes from Big Bang Theory:

Raj: I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.
Sheldon: Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

Leonard: My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, 
what you're really doing is becoming interesting. When people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot 
cooler than they thought. And for those of you that were popular in high school, it's over, sorry. Thank you. Congratulations.

Sheldon: Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why. 
Penny: Okay, were you talking before she got upset? 
Sheldon: Yes. 
Penny: That's probably it.
