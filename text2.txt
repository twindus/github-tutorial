Raj: I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.

Penny: Okay, were you talking before she got upset?
Sheldon: Yes.
Penny: That's probably it.

Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
Howard: That's true, you'd rust.

Sheldon: Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

Stuart: Oh, Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.

Howard: You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.

Penny: Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?
Amy: Yeah, but it's okay.
Penny: How is it okay?
Amy: I promised myself if I ever got friends I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.

Nick: One question? How do we know it won't blow up.
Lenard: The laser?
Nick: No, the moon.
